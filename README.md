# 📝 Notes Application

A secure and modern web-based Notes Application that enables users to register, authenticate, and manage personal notes. The frontend is built with **Next.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, using **JWT** for secure authentication. Data is stored in **PostgreSQL** (or NeonDB).
